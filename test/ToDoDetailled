Whole contract Test : 

Params to be changes for testing :

	BNB min for buy back : 0.01 BNB
	Max hodler : 10
	Token min to add to liquidity : 1billion tokens (10**9 x 10**10)


_ Deploy contract : 
	Keep token in contract 6 trillion
	Send token to owner 4 trillion
	
_ Add liquidity : 
	Normally this is done by DxSale => need liquidity for swaps
	100 billion (10**11 x 10**10) added to liquidity plus 10BNB (10 x 10**18)
	=> 10 BNB = 10*11 SHP
	=> 1 BNB = 10**10 SHP
	
_ Buys of 0.1 BNB (or 10**9 SHP) => *BuyerFee = 20*10**6 SHP (50 swaps necessary for min liquidity add)
_ Sells of 0.1 BNB 	(or 10**9 SHP) => *SellerFee = 40*10**6 SHP (25 swaps necessary for min liquidity add)


1er Test : 
	Perform transactions until adding liquidity
	Meanwhile Keep track of : 
		_ Nb of hodlers
		_ total fees
		_ Seller fees
		_ Buyer fees
		_ total burn
		_ Balance of token in contract
		_ Balance of BNB in contract	
	
_ Perform a certain amount of transaction between 2, 3, 4 and 5 users. Then after some time augment the number of participants

_ Check if auto LP works

_ Check if auto Buyback works

_ Check if the burn function works		

_ Check balance of LP tokens
